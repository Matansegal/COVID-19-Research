This repo contains our efforts to build Natural Language Processing tools to assist researchers around the world with processing ~51,000 research papers related to COVID-19 and similar coronaviruses. All work was done my several undergraduate members of the SMU AI Lab with the guidance of SMU AI Lab faculty. 

Note: This repo is a work in progress. The documentation is still light and unorganized. Please be patient for a final release of our work. 

The dataset used in this repo is provided by the Allen Institute For AI and posted on Kaggle.com. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge
